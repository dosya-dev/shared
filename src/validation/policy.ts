/**
 * The one place every input rule in dosya.dev is written down.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE IS COPIED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
 *
 * Three of the five surfaces cannot import from `@dosya-dev/shared`:
 *
 *   - `apps/web` is deployed from a mirror that contains only `apps/web/`, so a
 *     `../../packages/*` reference escapes that repo and fails the Cloudflare
 *     Pages build (see the note in its vite.config.ts).
 *   - `apps/mobile` is deliberately decoupled from the package (see
 *     `src/lib/format.ts`); EAS builds the working directory.
 *   - `apps/api` carries no dependency on it either.
 *
 * The previous answer to that was to hand-write the same rule in each place and
 * hope. That is how mobile's sign-up ended up validating nothing at all while
 * desktop validated four password clauses, and how the four share routes drifted
 * until one of them was skipping the password minimum the others enforced.
 *
 * So this module is written to be COPIED: it has no imports, no dependencies,
 * and no environment assumptions. `scripts/gen-validation-policy.mjs` emits a
 * byte-identical copy into each decoupled app and `--check` fails the gate when
 * a copy is stale. Desktop and the CLI, which CAN import the package, import it
 * directly and get the same code by a shorter route.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO CONVENTIONS THAT MAKE THIS USABLE FROM A FORM
 *
 *   1. Every validator returns `string | null` - the message to show, or null
 *      when the value passes. Not a boolean, because a boolean forces the caller
 *      to invent the sentence, and an invented sentence is how a client ends up
 *      disagreeing with the server about what the rule even is.
 *
 *   2. The message is the SERVER's message, verbatim. A client that pre-checks
 *      shows exactly what it would have got back from the API, so pre-checking
 *      changes only the latency, never the wording.
 *
 * Changing a message here changes it on every surface at once. That is the point.
