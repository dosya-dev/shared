/**
 * The activity feed's shared vocabulary: which actions belong to which
 * category, what each action reads as, and how to name the device behind a
 * user-agent string.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE IS COPIED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
 *
 * Same three surfaces as the validation policy (see
 * packages/shared/src/validation/policy.ts for the full account): apps/web
 * deploys from a mirror holding only apps/web/, apps/mobile is decoupled on
 * purpose, and apps/api carries no dependency on this package. So this module
 * is written to be COPIED: no imports, no dependencies, no environment
 * assumptions. `scripts/gen-activity-catalog.mjs` emits a byte-identical copy
 * into each of the three, and the activity-catalog-sync suite in
 * scripts/test-all.mjs fails the gate when a copy goes stale.
 *
 * Before this existed the table lived in three hand-written places -
 * /api/activity's ACTION_CATEGORIES, web's activity page, and mobile's - which
 * meant a new action code had to be added three times or the category filter
 * silently matched nothing for it.
 *
 * Not every copy uses every export: the API only reads CATEGORY_ACTION_NAMES.
 * That is the ordinary cost of a byte-identical copy, and cheaper than three
 * files that disagree.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ADDING AN ACTION
 *
 *   1. Add it to CATEGORY_ACTIONS under exactly one category. The endpoint ORs
 *      the actions of every selected category, so a duplicate binds twice.
 *   2. Give it an ACTION_LABELS phrase that reads after an actor's name.
 *   3. Run: node scripts/gen-activity-catalog.mjs
